Materials associated with the paper "Palaeolatitudinal distribution of lithologic indicators of climate in a palaeogeographic framework"

the change is here 

This repository documents the data and the data analysis and figure generation codes used for the paper:

Cao, W., Williams, S., Flament, N., Zahirovic, S., Scotese, C., and MÃ¼ller, R. D., 2018. Paleolatitudinal distribution of lithologic indicators of climate in a paleogeographic framework. Geological Magazine, 1-24.

Code folder

The code folder contains several Jupyter notebook with code written in Python 2.7. These notebook contain the data analysis and figure generation code used for the paper. It utilizes standard scientific Python modules as well as modules from the open source PmagPy project (https://github.com/PmagPy/) and pygplates which provides a Python API to the open source GPlates software (https://www.gplates.org/).

The Jupyter notebook can be viewed as static html here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Swanson-Hysell/2017_Taconic/blob/master/Code/Taconic_Arc_Paleogeography.html
Data folder

The data folder contains subfolders related to geological data (Geology).
